# Physical-Design-of-Single-Port-RAM
This repository contains materials related to the RTL to GDS flow and the concept of single-port memory.
# Abstract:
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the RTL (Register Transfer Level) to GDS (Graphic Data System) flow, a critical process in digital circuit design. The project covers every step of the flow, from RTL design using hardware description languages, synthesis to gate-level representations, placement and routing, to the final GDSII file generation. A significant portion of the project is dedicated to discussing the concept and theory of memory, with a particular focus on single-port memory.
